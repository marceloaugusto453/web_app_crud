#  Complete Web Application with FastAPI, Streamlit, and Docker Compose


This project is a boilerplate for a complete web application, with a **backend** and **frontend** developed in Python and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**. It serves as a robust starting point for building scalable, modern applications with consistent development and production environments.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

* **Backend:** Built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy** (ORM), and **Pydantic** to create a robust, asynchronous REST API with automatic data validation.
* **Frontend:** An interactive web interface developed with **Streamlit**, which consumes the backend API to create, read, update, and delete data.
* **Database:** Uses **PostgreSQL** in a Docker container, with data persistence via a volume.
* **Orchestration:** **Docker Compose** is used to easily configure and manage all application services (backend, frontend, and database).
